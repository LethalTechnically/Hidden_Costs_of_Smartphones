<!-- Introduction -->
<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        While gadgets provide convenience and connectivity, their production often involves serious hidden costs. These costs are not visible to consumers but affect workers, communities, and the environment. This page examines key problems such as child labour, environmental pollution, and low wages, and explains their causes and effects.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- Child Labour -->
<section>
    <h2>1. Child Labour in Mining</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p><strong>Cause:</strong> The high global demand for minerals such as cobalt and lithium has led to mining in regions with weak labour laws. Families living in poverty may rely on children to work in mines to earn income.</p>
            <p><strong>Effect:</strong> Children are exposed to dangerous working conditions, including toxic dust and unstable tunnels. This affects their health and prevents them from attending school, limiting their future opportunities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <img src="images/child-labor.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" alt="Child labour in mining">
        </div>
    </div>
</section>

<!-- Environmental Pollution -->
<section>
    <h2>2. Environmental Pollution</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Mining and factory production release harmful chemicals into soil and water. Electronic waste is often dumped in landfills instead of being recycled properly.</p>
            <p><strong>Effect:</strong> Pollution damages ecosystems, contaminates water supplies, and increases health risks for nearby communities. Wildlife habitats are destroyed due to deforestation and mining activities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <img src="images/pollution.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" alt="Environmental pollution from industry">
        </div>
    </div>
</section>

<!-- Low Wages and Unsafe Work -->
<section>
    <h2>3. Low Wages and Unsafe Working Conditions</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p><strong>Cause:</strong> To reduce production costs, many companies outsource manufacturing to countries where labour is cheaper and safety regulations may be limited.</p>
            <p><strong>Effect:</strong> Factory workers may work long hours for low pay in unsafe environments. This can lead to physical injuries, stress, and limited quality of life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <img src="images/factory-conditions.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" alt="Factory working conditions">
        </div>
    </div>
</section>

<!-- Electronic Waste -->
<section>
    <h2>4. Electronic Waste (E-Waste)</h2>
    <p>
        When gadgets are discarded, they become electronic waste. Many devices contain toxic materials such as lead and mercury.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Rapid technological change encourages consumers to replace devices frequently instead of repairing them.</p>
    <p><strong>Effect:</strong> E-waste pollutes land and water and can harm the health of workers who dismantle devices without protective equipment.</p>
</section>

<!-- Evidence -->
<section>
    <h2>Evidence from Research</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>UNICEF reports that thousands of children work in cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</li>
        <li>The World Health Organization has linked electronic waste exposure to respiratory and neurological health problems.</li>
        <li>UNEP states that mining activities contribute significantly to deforestation and water contamination.</li>
    </ul>
